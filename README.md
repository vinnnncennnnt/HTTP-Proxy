# HTTP-Proxy

It is preferable to use a chromium based web browser. Please notre that it is important to clear cache before launching the proxy (and to clear it again after each modification made to the configuration file)

The configuration parameters are loaded from the ```config.json``` file and can be accessed and modified via the links (once the proxy is launched) :
- accessible via ```http://config/home```
- modified via ```http://config```
